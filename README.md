# 100-Days-100-Python-Projects

This is my 100 days 100 python projects repository
I'm going to add my python projects here that I create over the next 100 days by using YouTube videos for learning and various ideas that pop up in my head.
hopefully this helps me get my basics back while getting me to the advanced level.

For anyone else reading this, this is more like a journal for the next hundred days as I will be adding my daily activities behind the project I build for the day and the issues I faced and how I came to solve it.


DAY 1: Band Name Generator:
Made a band name generator using the unique_names_generator package. Got the idea from the 100 days 100 projects video, but tweaked it a bit.
In the video we only take 2 user input strings and concatenate them. In this I added 2 options, a completely random name generator and one that takes some user input and concatenates it with an adjective.
Also added a loop so that it gives at least 10 output names for either option.

DAY 2: House Loan Calculator:
Made a house loan calculator, fairly easy as it was only implementing the math formula. Used babel package to get the output in indian currency system.
